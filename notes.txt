Brief:
  Written in Asmebly with a CPP driver code, calculate distances, speeds and times 

Prompt:
  Jacob Corletto, a student of 240 in an earlier semester, goes frequently to Las Vegas. There
  he studies the operation of the roulette wheel for scientific knowledge. The distance from CSUF
  East Parking structure to the valet parking at the Luxor hotel is 253.5 miles. On a typical
  Monday or Wednesday he leaves CSUF at 10am and rides a Harley FXDR114 non-stop to the
  Luxor. During the iritial part of the trip he rides at a safe average speed of <input number here>
  mph. After traveling <input#miles> he sees that no members of the CHP are in the vicinty, and
  therefore, finishes the final leg of the trip at <input speed here> mph. He maintains that final
  speed until he arrives at valet parking of the Luxor. After checking into his suite he participates
  in the 240 lecture at 2pm, after which goes to scientifically research why roulette wheels spin.

Questions to be answered by software:
  What was Richardâ€™s average speed for the entire trip?
  How much time in hours was required to make the complete trip?

variables:
  distance = 253.5 miles
  first speed = user input
  first leg = user input
  second leg = distance - first leg
  second speed = user input
  
  final time = (first leg / first speed) + (second leg / second speed)
  average speed = (first speed + second speed) / final time
